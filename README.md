PLEASE DO NOT COPY THIS PROJECT AS YOU WILL GET IN TROUBLE. THIS REPOSITORY WAS CREATED AS A STORAGE AND A LEARNING PROSPECTIVE FOR PEOPLE WILLING TO USE PARTS OF THE CODE TO HELP IF THEY ARE STUCK.

Entire project is separated into several files for greater break-down and easier debugging, but could be merged into a single file if necessary.
Whole NEA is written in a word document, which is annotated in details.

Do not hesitate to ask me any questions if they arise.
